# TypeORM + Sqlite3 + Express Boilerplate
Boilerplate for TypeORM + Sqlite3 + Express Combo.

## What's in here?
- TypeScript
- TypeORM
- Sqlite3

## Getting Started
Make sure you already installed Sqlite3 in your device.

To install Sqlite3, [visit official download page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run.

```bash
$ npm start
```

To allow auto reload(with Nodemon):

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Heavily recommend use "npm run dev" only in Development mode.
